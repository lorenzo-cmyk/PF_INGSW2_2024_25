## About the project

S&C is a web application designed to connect students and companies, streamlining the internship recruitment process.

The platform enables students to discover internships matching their skills and interests, while companies can find 
suitable candidates through customized questionnaires and evaluations. Using recommendation algorithms, S&C suggests 
relevant opportunities to students based on their capabilities and helps companies identify matching candidates. The 
platform facilitates the entire internship lifecycle, including application management, progress tracking, and feedback 
collection, with universities mediating any disputes.

By bridging the gap between academic and professional environments, S&C aims to reduce skill mismatches by helping 
students gain practical experience while providing companies access to talented candidates.
